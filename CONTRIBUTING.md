# Contribute
Feel free to submit pull requests to support development.
The most important thing first: If you are unsure about things, you can always ask ;)

## Things to consider when submitting PRs
* **Always** submit your PR against the develop branch
* Keep the PR small.
* Ensure all unit tests pass. (If you add new features, tests would be nice)
* Respect the coding standards.
* Give some info on what/why you've done.
* Don't be sad if a PR is rejected (hopefully this won't happen often)
* Don't be sad if a PR is accepted but I tweak some things in it

## Where can I help?
The [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheSylence/Twice/issues) would be the best place to search for things that have to be done ;)

## Branching model
I more or less use the [Git flow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). This means all development is done in the *develop* branch and *master* reflects the latest released version.

# Coding standards
Until I find the time to make a detailed list of things to keep in mind, just try to make new code look the same as existing code.
