# Contribute
Feel free to report issues or submit pull requests to support development.
The most important thing first: If you are unsure about things, you can always ask ;)

## Reporting issues
First make sure that the issue hasn't been reported by someone else. If it has, simply subscribe to the existing report to get notified about updates.
If you fill a report, do your best to describe:
- What version are you using? (Application and Windows)
- What have you done? (This is the most important part. The harder an issue is to reproduce the longer it will take to fix it)
- What did you expect to happen?
- What happend instead?

Remember that you can attach images to an issue to make things even clearer.

### Things to consider when submitting PRs
* **Always** submit your PR against the develop branch
* Keep the PR small.
* Ensure all unit tests pass. (If you add new features, tests would be nice)
* Respect the coding standards.
* Give some info on what/why you've done.
* Don't be sad if a PR is rejected (hopefully this won't happen often)
* Don't be sad if a PR is accepted but I tweak some things in it

### Where can I help?
The [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheSylence/Twice/issues) would be the best place to search for things that have to be done ;)

### Branching model
I more or less use the [Git flow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). This means all development is done in the *develop* branch and *master* reflects the latest released version.

## Coding standards
Until I find the time to make a detailed list of things to keep in mind, just try to make new code look the same as existing code.
